Hi, I’m @moritz-konarski, alumnus of [AUCA](https://auca.kg) and current student at [Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/).

I have a BA in applied mathematics and informatics, spent a year teaching English and informatics at [TSI AUCA](https://tsiauca.kg/en/) in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, and I'm currently based near Tübingen, Germany. Right now, I'm working on my [M. Sc. in Medical Informatics](https://uni-tuebingen.de/de/111851) in the class of 2024.
